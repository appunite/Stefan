## Why?

As mobile developers we all have to handle displaying collections of data. But is it always as simple as it sounds?

Looks like spaghetti? It is a common situation that application displays data / placeholders (which may be different depending for example on loading state) and some of us end up with defining states and tangling everything together.

**Stefan** is a framework that helps you to manage states in your collection views. Basically it is a middleman between data source and the view itself. Of course it supports UITableView and UICollectionView out of box, but it is up to you to decide what is your **ReloadableView** and what is **PlaceholderView**. It contains most commonly used states that might occur when loading data collection. 

### Basic setup 

- Define `Stefan` object, the best solution is to define one `Stefan` per one `ReloadableView`.
- Connect Stefan's `reloadableView` and `placeholderPresenter` (which both might be `nil`).
> Remember: class that implements LoadableStatePlaceholderPresentable must have a **weak** reference to a placeholderView.
- Call `stefan.load(newState: ...)` 

Example of setup:

```swift
private func setupStefan() {
	viewModel.stefan.reloadableView = self.tableView
	viewModel.stefan.placeholderPresenter = self
	viewModel.stefan.load(newState: .noContent) // initial state
}
```

For reading current items just call 

```swift
try stefan.state.items()
```

### Few words about placeholder

- We have tried to make it as flexible as possible so you can provide a custom placeholder view which should conform to `LoadableStatePlaceholderView` and also implement `ItemsLoadableStateBindable` protocol. To display custom placeholder view just implement your own version of function `customPlaceholderView` that is handled by Stefan's `placeholderPresenter`. 

Example for customization: 

```swift
public func customPlaceholderView() -> LoadableStatePlaceholderView {
	let view = LoadingPlaceholderView.instanceFromNib()
    view.dataSource = self.viewModel
    return view
}
```

- There is also a default placeholder view built from title, subtitle and activity indicator which might also be useful for you. Feel free to see how it works in the example project. 

### Closures

To make Stefan fully generic we provided delegate by common closures pattern. Following delegate closures are available: 

```swift
public var shouldReload: ((ReloadableView!) -> Bool)
    
public var didChangeState: ((ItemsLoadableState<ItemType>) -> Void)
    
public var shouldDisplayPlaceholder: ((ItemsLoadableState<ItemType>) -> Bool)
```

### Differing 

Stefan provides default implementation of differring function which result should be `ItemReloadingResult`. This result tells Stefan what should be reloaded (or maybe there is nothing to do for him). You can provide your own implementation by defining 

`stefan.statesDiffer = ...` 

Please remember that this is a weak object so you have to handle retaining it. 

Stefan has a `Differ` dependency which is needed for performing fast operations on collections while comparing. When initializing Stefan you are able to provide reloading type which might be `animated` or `basic`. By default animations are disabled, but when you'll enable it Stefan will handle collection animation automatically by himself.
